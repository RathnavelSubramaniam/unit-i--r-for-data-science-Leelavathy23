Question 1
What happens if you make a scatterplot of class versus drv? Why is the plot not
useful?
    
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=class,y=drv))+
		geom_point()
```
Answer:
The plot is not useful because the variables drv and class are categorical variables.


Question 2
What?s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
```{r}
     ggplot(data = mpg) +
	geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))

```

Ans: The points are not blue because the parameter color is included with aesthetic.  If color is placed outside it 
displays the points in blue color.
```{r}
	ggplot(data = mpg) +
	  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

```

	
Question 3
a) What happens if you map a aesthetic to something other than a variable name,
like aes(colour = displ < 5)?
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
	  	geom_point(aes(x=displ,y=hwy,colour=displ<5))
	 

```

	Ans:  ggplot(data=mpg)+
	  	geom_point(aes(x=displ,y=hwy,colour=displ<5))
	 

b) What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
        Ans: ggplot(data=mpg)+
		  geom_point(aes(x=displ,y=hwy), stroke=3)
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
		  geom_point(aes(x=displ,y=hwy), shape=21,stroke=3)

```
Answer:Stoke is used to adjust the border size for shapes.  It work with points(geom_point) shape.


Question 4
 Read? Facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options
control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn?t facet_grid() have nrow and
ncol variables?

Answer:  Faced grids do not have these configuration because the rows and cols are determined by the specified attributes.

```{r}
?facet_wrap

```

Question 5
a) What plots does the following code make? What does . do?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(drv ~ .)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
b) When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?

Answer:a) Faced_grid divides the plot in the particular area.That is used to make the plot into subplot.
      b) Because it gives meaningful interpretation.
      
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(drv ~ .)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

```



Question 6
What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area
chart?
	
Ans:	
	line chart: geom_line()
	box plot: geom_boxplot()
	histogram: geom_histogram()
	area chart: geom_area()
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
		  geom_line(aes(x=displ,y=hwy))

ggplot(data=mpg)+
		  geom_boxplot(aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
ggplot(data=mpg)+
		  geom_area(aes(x=displ,y=hwy))





```
	


Question 7

Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth()


```

```{r}
ggplot() +
geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```
 Ans: No, the two graphs looks similar.  Because both geom_point() and geom_smooth() use same data and mappings.
 

Question 8
What does geom_col() do? How is different to geom_bar()?
Answer: geom_col() requires both x and y whereas geom_bar() requires only x variable.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
	geom_col(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
	geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class))
```

Question 9
What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?
  Answer: The default geom associated with stat_summary is geom_pointrange.
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
 geom_pointrange(aes(x=displ,y=hwy),
              stat="summary",
               fun.ymin=min,
               fun.ymax=max,
               fun=median)

```
  


Question 10
What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway
mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping =aes(x =cty, y =hwy)) +
geom_point() +
geom_abline() +
coord_fixed()

Answer:
When city milage increases hwy mileage also increases.  There is a positive relationship between city milage and hwy milage.
   Coord_fixed:  Adjust the values in the data set. 
   abline()   :  It shows the prediction between x and y. It shows 
                 Regression line.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping =aes(x =cty, y =hwy)) +
geom_point() +
geom_abline() +
coord_fixed()

```
